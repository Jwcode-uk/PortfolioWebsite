            The Emerging Cybersecurity Threats in the Age of AI: The Hidden Dangers of ChatGPT,
            Generative AI, and AI-Generated Code
          </h2>
          <p className="blog-author">By Jonathan White</p>
          <hr className="blog-divider" />
          <p className="blog-body">
            As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to make strides in the digital landscape,
            providers like ChatGPT are becoming increasingly attractive targets for nation-state
            cyber threat actors and sophisticated cyber mercenaries. These threat actors are
            capable of intercepting company or user-specific input to intelligent chatbots,
            which can disclose a wealth of confidential information ranging from personal data
            to trade secrets. They can also manipulate and provide backdoored answers to specific
            users or organizations with the intent to cause harm. Additionally, AI-generated code
            may introduce cybersecurity vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors.
            In this blog post, we&apos;ll explore the potential cybersecurity threats that arise
            with the widespread use of AI like ChatGPT, generative AI technologies,
            and AI-generated code.
          </p>
          <p className="blog-body">
            Generative AI, which includes tools like ChatGPT, may deceptively obtain and hide
            data usage by incorporating clauses in their Terms of Service that authorize them
            to use your data for AI training purposes. For instance, if a contract is uploaded
            for signature through a SaaS document management platform or sent via a cloud mail
            provider, its entire content might be exploited in ways you never anticipated.
          </p>
          <p className="blog-body">
            Moreover, AI-generated code, which is becoming increasingly popular for software
            development, may inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities that cyber threat actors
            can exploit, potentially compromising the security and functionality of applications.
          </p>
          <p className="blog-body">This deceptive data usage and AI-generated code can lead to several cybersecurity risks:</p>
          <ol className="blog-body">
            <li>
              Unauthorized access to sensitive information:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Theoretical example: A threat actor intercepts a company&apos;s proprietary
                  algorithm shared through an AI chatbot, leading to the theft of intellectual
                  property and competitive advantage.

                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              Manipulation of AI-generated responses:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Theoretical example: A cybercriminal compromises an AI-based customer
                  support chatbot and modifies its responses to trick customers into divulging
                  their credit card information.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              Erosion of trust in AI systems:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Theoretical example: A high-profile data breach involving AI-generated content
                  undermines public confidence in AI technologies, causing businesses to delay or
                  cancel AI adoption.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              Introduction of vulnerabilities through AI-generated code:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Theoretical example: An AI-generated code snippet contains a hidden security
                  flaw that allows hackers to gain unauthorized access to a company&apos;s database,
                  resulting in a data breach and loss of sensitive information.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p className="blog-body">To mitigate these risks, companies and individuals should adopt the following best practices:</p>
          <ol className="blog-body">
            <li>
              Review AI providers&apos; Terms of Service: Before using an AI service, carefully
              review their Terms of Service to understand how your data will be used and protected.
              Be cautious of any clauses that allow for the use of your data for AI training
              purposes without your explicit consent.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implement robust cybersecurity measures: Employ strong encryption, multi-factor
              authentication, and regular security audits to protect your sensitive data and
              communications from unauthorized access.
            </li>
            <li>
              Monitor AI-generated outputs: Regularly review AI-generated content and code for
              signs of manipulation or unusual behavior that may indicate a security breach.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stay informed about emerging threats: Keep up-to-date with the latest
              cybersecurity news and trends, and ensure your organization&apos;s security policies
              and procedures evolve to address new risks.
            </li>
